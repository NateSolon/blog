    "A quick aside on equity: Analytical-minded people who don't play a lot of poker often ask some version of the question, \"Isn't poker just math?\" By math, I think they usually mean something like equity. Basically, how often would your hand win if you just dealt out the rest of the cards. This does seem extremely relevant, so why isn't it the whole story? Well, if you or your opponent is all-in, it is nearly the whole story. But if you're not all-in, you don't just deal out the cards and see who wins. You engage in a series of strategic interactions where you and your opponent try to outmaneuver each other. In this struggle, hands can perform better or worse than their equity would suggest. This part of poker is described by an entirely different branch of math: game theory."

    "\n",
    "To calculate that you can use another function from the itertools module, `starmap`, which applies a function to each item of an iterable. In this case, to get the equity against their range, for each hand you can multiply the number of combos by your equity against that hand, and finally divide by the total number of combos to get the weighted average."
