    "Suppose you're playing No Limit Hold'em, and based on how your opponent has played the hand, you believe they have pocket aces, pocket kings, or ace-king. How likely is each hand? (Hint: They're not equally likely!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The math that determines the likelihood of each hand is called combinatorics and it's in a sweet spot of being non-obvious, yet pretty easy to understand, and highly relevant for in-game strategy. I just finished [Fluent Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) by Luciano Ramalho and got a refresher on the [Python built-in itertools module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), which provides the necessary tools to explore combinatorics. Itertools provides functions for creating iterators. Of particular interest for poker are the \"combinatoric iterators,\" such as `product` and `combinations`, which combine elements together. These will be useful for combining ranks and suits to form cards, combining cards to form combinations, and ultimately understanding the relative likelihood of different hands.\n",
